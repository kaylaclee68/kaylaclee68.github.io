        <h1>Programming Project #1: Images of the Russian Empire: </h1>
        <h3>Kayla Lee</h3>
        
        <h2>Goal</h2>
        <p>Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii (1863-1944) [Сергей Михайлович Прокудин-Горский, 
            to his Russian friends] was a man well ahead of his time. 
            Convinced, as early as 1907, that color photography was the 
            wave of the future, he won Tzar's special permission to travel
             across the vast Russian Empire and take color photographs of
              everything he saw including the only color portrait of Leo
               Tolstoy. And he really photographed everything: people,
                buildings, landscapes, railroads, bridges... thousands of
                 color pictures! His idea was simple: record three
                  exposures of every scene onto a glass plate using a red, 
                  a green, and a blue filter. Never mind that there was 
                  no way to print color photographs until much later -- he 
                  envisioned special projectors to be installed in 
                  "multimedia" classrooms all across Russia where the children would be able to learn about
             their vast country. Alas, his plans never materialized: he left Russia in 1918, 
             right after the revolution, never to return again. Luckily,
              his RGB glass plate negatives, capturing the last years of the Russian Empire,
               survived and were purchased in 1948 by the Library of Congress. The LoC has 
               recently digitized the negatives and made them available on-line.</p>

        <p>
            The goal of this assignment is to take the digitized Prokudin-Gorskii glass plate 
            images and, using image processing techniques, automatically produce a color image 
            with as few visual artifacts as possible. In order to do this, I will 
            extract the three color channel images, place them on top of each other, and align 
            them so that they form a single RGB color image.
        </p>

        <h2>Method</h2>
        <h3>Splitting:</h3>
        <p> Given that color channels are put in the order of b, g, r from top to bottom, I separated 
                to three channel images with this function. 
        </p>

        <pre>

        </pre>
        
        <h3>Aligning:</h3>
        <h4>Aligning raw pixels: </h4>
        <p> I used window size of 15 to loop through a horizontal/vertical transformations of (-15, 15) for each red/green channel to blue. By doing so, I tried to find the best offset (shift) that can get us the minimized error. 
        </p>

        <p>
            This exhaustive search of "double for loop" is extremely inefficient to large .tif images which are quiet large in size. Thus, I used <b>image pyramids</b> instead. 
            Pyramid is stored in a python list. 
        </p>   
        <p>
            Starting with level 0, 1x scale of original image, we will scale down by 1/2x as level goes up and each of these downscaled images will be appended to the list. 
            In total, a 4 layer pyramid will have <b>1x, 1/2x, 1/4x, 1/8x, 1/16x</b> the size of original image. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, in the reverse order, from highest level to the lowest level, with highest level representing a smallest image with the lowest resolution, I aligned the image and find the offset each time. 
            
            As the level goes down, offset from previous level should be doubled up (x2) before aligning (because we should account for image_size getting bigger as it levels down each time) and add up current offset 
            at current level with previous level's offset. This allows us to decrease the search window as the image gets bigger, and gives significant speedup with coarse to fine approach.
        </p>    

        <h3>Cropping:</h3>
        <p> 
            Borders on scanned negative images due to issues like film damage can affect alignment as they contain a large region of white or black pixels. My experiments showed that manually cropping 1/7th of the image size from each side 
            yielded the best alignment when compared to other cropping ratios (1/30, 1/10).
        </p>
    
        <h2>Bells & Whistles</h2>
        <h4> Edge Detection: </h4>
        <p> Some images, like “emir.tif,” experience misalignment due to significant color discrepancies across channels, as seen with emir’s predominantly blue dress, 
            which results in dark pixels in some channels (red) and light pixels in others (blue). To address this, I used edge detection with skimage’ roberts filters, which improved alignment accuracy for “emir.tif.”
            I discovered that roberts filter improved visual accuracy in all images.
        </p>
